# TEJ20R Real World Vending Machine Project
by Sanchit Khope

# Function:
### The function of this project is to dispense candy and chocolates from a vending machine.
# Explanation
### So my project is a simple 3 product vending machine. In this project the goal is to press a code E.g. A1, A2), and then to input some money into the machine. Then this machine will output a product. If more than 2 buttons are pressed at one timer then the program will shut down. If only the code is typed and no money is inputted then the program will not run. Both the money and the code need to be inputted for the system to work. Then the first breadboard will feed into a NAND gate. As the NAND gates provide a mostly high output to a NPN transistor, the 555 timer remains turned off. However if the NAND gate provides a LOW output, then a signal will be sent to the reset pin of the 555 timer to turn it ON
